# Removed FastAPI and BaseModel imports as they are not needed for a simple function module
# from fastapi import FastAPI
# from pydantic import BaseModel

# Removed FastAPI app instance

# Removed the conflicting StockInput model definition
# class StockInput(BaseModel):
#     symbol: str
#     start_date: str  # Format: YYYY-MM-DD
#     end_date: str

# Renamed function to predict_stock and updated signature and logic
